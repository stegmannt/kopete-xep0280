== About ==

This is a fork of the Kopete messenger, intended to implement XEP-0280 aka message carbons

== What works (tested with prosody 0.9) ==

* Automaticly enables message carbons after login
* Receive forwarded message carbons from other clients

== What parts of XEP-0280 have not been implemented (yet) ==

* Disabling message carbons while being logged in.
* Config option to disable message carbons
* Proper handling of </gone> chat state message
* Discovering server support (not very important)
* Avoiding Carbons for a single message (no idea how to do that easily)
* Taking care of auto-responses

== What won't work anymore ==

* Off-the-Record messaging 

== Disclaimer ==

I'm not an experienced KDE/Kopete programmer nor a XMPP professional. Consider the patch as lousy.
For any suggestions please use the issue tracker.

== Install ==

Kopete, The KDE Messenger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kopete is an Instant Messaging client designed to be modular and plugin based.

It requires the KDE Desktop, version 4.4 or higher.

Kopete ships with a lot of protocol plugins, supporting nine different messaging
systems.  All plugins have seen numerous enhancements and bugfixes since the
last release and should bring your Kopete experience to a whole new level.

Additionally a lot of work has gone into cleaning up the core Kopete API and
GUI with several important usability-, stability- and performance-improvements.

The Kopete team consists now of several active developers, working on the
various plugins and the core API. However, Kopete wouldn't be in the shape
in which it is now without the various contributions from KDE developers
all over the world and the high-quality bug reports from active users.
Thanks to all of you for your support and your interest in Kopete!

As always, more bug reports and patches are welcome.
Please use http://bugs.kde.org.

The Kopete main developers can be contacted on our mailing list,
kopete-devel@kde.org, and on IRC in #kopete, on irc.freenode.net.
We always welcome new contributors.
